# Auto Colleague Pub Email Generator  

The unrelenting march of automation has finally had an impact on my career.
What will we spend several hours every Friday morning doing now we don't have to write pub emails?

The text is generated using a python script which I give minimal prompts.  
That script can be found in the existing_model_generator directory.

One day I might make my own text generation model using old pub emails as the training data but that sounds unreasonably difficult for something you do for a laugh on a whim on a weekend.
